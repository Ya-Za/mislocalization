# Examine the Link Between Persistent Activity in Extrastriate Areas and the Biases in Spatial Perception During Saccades

Our modeling approach provides a powerful means for predicting perisaccadic perceptual phenomena and then testing the contribution of each neurophysiological component in generating them, thus linking perisaccadic neuronal changes to perceptual changes during eye movements. In psychophysical experiments, humans mislocalize stimuli appearing just prior to or during saccades. Here, we show the same psychophysical perisaccadic mislocalization phenomena in monkeys. This allows us to directly tie reported localizations to the responses of visual neurons during the behavioral task, and so evaluate the role of the various perisaccadic changes (FF & ST remapping, and persistent activity) to the perceived stimulus location on a trial by trial basis. We can further compare behavioral reports to the model-generated readout based on neuronal responses, allowing us to tie perisaccadic neuronal changes to their perceptual counterpart.
